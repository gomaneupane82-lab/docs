Add animations to any website or app just by describing what you want.

Here's a video tutorial showing how to add animations in Create:

  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; fullscreen"
  allowFullScreen
  webkitallowfullscreen="true"
  mozallowfullscreen="true"
></iframe>


## Hover animations

Here's an example [webinar landing page](https://www.create.xyz/share/d523e4aa-72dd-4140-83cb-8d5cef203244) with a first load animation and a button hover animation. The animations were created with this prompt:

```
Button
- Hover effect animation, left to right slide, change the background to white and the text to black

First load animation
- The image should expand to fill the space
- The text flies in from the left side
```

## Scroll effects

Adding parallax scrolling or other scroll effects is as easy as just adding that to your prompt. Here's a [coffee shop website](https://www.create.xyz/share/224c4f9b-57a3-42d9-94da-124b3a27dda0) with a simple prompt:

```
Generate a coffee shop website with parallax scrolling

Background image: https://images.pexels.com/photos/683039/pexels-photo-683039.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=800
The background image should scroll too but at a slower pace
```

## Animations from code

You can also paste in animation code snippets (in any programming language) and Create will reproduce them. Here's an [example project](https://www.create.xyz/share/b172593e-2aa9-4780-ba5e-95a0d9e3e72c) that converts a long Javascript animation to simple CSS.
