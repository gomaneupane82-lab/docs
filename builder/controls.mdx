## Chat

You chat with Create to build your app. Tell it what to build using text or images:

- You can paste imges into the chat
- Press `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter` on Windows) to send messages
- Create uses your app's code and chat history to generate updates
  - Paid plans get enhanced AI generations with more context
- When you select a **specific element**, messages update only that element
- When you select the **project name** in the [**Project Selector**](/builder/controls#project-selector) or the **canvas**, messages can modify multiple elements at once
- **Discussion Mode** - chat without making edits by clicking on the speech bubble icon labeled _Discuss_. It can be important at times to prevent edits to your work and be able to ask questions of the builder about status, approach or specific features without allowing it to alter your current design.

## Generations

Control the scope of Create's changes by selecting different elements:

- **Project**:
  - Select the **project name** in [**Project Selector**](/builder/controls#project-selector) or tap the **canvas**
  - Create's chat can modify multiple elements at once
  - Can add new [Pages](/builder/pages), [Components](/builder/components), [Functions](/builder/functions) as needed
  - Best for building features that span elements
- **Element**:
  - Select a specific **element name** in the [**Project Selector**](/builder/controls#project-selector) or tap it on the **canvas**
  - Create's chat modifies just that element
  - Changes confined to just that [Page](/builder/pages), [Component](/builder/components), or [Function](/builder/functions)
  - Best for focused updates and refinements to each element

<Tip>
  See our [Guide to Prompting](/prompting#project-wide-vs-single-element) for level-specific prompting tips.
