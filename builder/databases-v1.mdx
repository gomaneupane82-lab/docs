Databases let you store information in your apps. They're essential for apps that need to remember data between uses - like user preferences, form submissions, user submissions, or content to display.

<Warning>
  This is a legacy article for a prior version of databases (for apps built in Create prior to February 2025).  The article for our current release is linked here!
</Warning>

## Convert to V2 Database (New Feature)

We now support converting legacy V1 databases to the new V2 format. This allows you to take advantage of all the new features in our updated database system.

<Frame caption="The conversion option is available in the dropdown menu in the top right corner">
  <img src="/images/databases/convert-button.png" />
</Frame>

**What happens during conversion:**
1. A new V2 database is created for you
2. Your data is migrated from V1 to V2
3. A function is created in your project to access the data
4. Your apps will automatically start using the new data store

**How to convert your database:**
1. Go to your V1 database at www.create.xyz/database/[DATABASE_ID]
2. Click the conversion option in the top right dropdown menu

After conversion, you can use the new database like any other V2 database in your project.

## Why Use Databases

Databases help you:

* Save user input across sessions

* Store content for your app

* Build apps with dynamic data

* Create admin interfaces to manage information

* Store information that's specific to each user to customize your app's experience per user

## Creating a Database

Create databases through:

**Chat**

* From the chat for a Page, Function, or Component

* Type`/`> "Data" > "Create a database"

* Name your database (e.g., "Feedback", "Products")

* Describe how you want to store data:

  * "Store waitlist signups with name and email in /\[WaitlistDB]"

  * "Store blog posts with title, content, and author in /\[BlogDB]"

  * "Store gallery submissions in /\[GalleryDB]. In the feed, retrieve submissions from /\[GalleryDB]"

* Send your prompt in the chat. Create generates the database schema and queries (inserts, updates, fetches).

* Test your database by using your Page/Function/Component in Demo mode.

  * If you tap on the database name in the chat, you can view the data.

  * From the[three dot menu](/builder/controls#top-nav)on the Page/Function/Component, you can go to Linked Data to see databases referenced by the element. This provides quick access to the database.

**Dashboard**

* Go to create.xyz/dashboard > Databases > New Database

* Name your database and submit

* Tap on the database name in the list to view its data

* (Optional) You can seed the initial schema / data with a CSV file

* Use it in the builder from a Page, Function, or Component with`/`> "Data" > "Select Database"

<Info>
  When you include a database in your prompt, Create generates queries based on your prompt's description. From these queries, it infers the database schema. It can:

  * Design tables from your description

  * Infer structure / schema from your UI

  * Follow specific schema requirements you provide (e.g. "Make a table for friends with name and age")
</Info>

## Using Your Database

Add databases to any page, component, or function:

1. Type`/`in chat

2. Select your database

3. Choose how to interact (insert, update, fetch)

4. Create adds the necessary queries to the code. It sets the schema for the database from the queries.

Your database appears in:

* Chat - tap to view data

* [Three dot menu](/builder/controls#three-dot-menu)on a Page/Function/Component - Linked Data

* Dashboard - create.xyz/dashboard > Databases

<Info>
  Use the same database across multiple elements or projects. This lets you build different interfaces for the same data.
</Info>

## Managing Data

You can manage the data in your database from the dashboard, the database viewer, or by building your own admin pages around it.

**Add Data**

* From the database viewer > upload CSV files to populate tables. The table schema is inferred from the CSV column headers.

* From your app after it's integrated > in either Demo mode or Publish, go through your app flows to insert into the database.

* Build your own admin tools:

  * Create custom admin interfaces:

    * New Page > / in chat > "Data" > "Select Database"

    * Describe your admin interface (e.g. "Make an admin interface for /\[your database] that lets me add/edit/delete submissions")

    * Create generates forms and tables to manage your data

    * Add fields, filters, and sorting as needed

  * Generate test data with AI:

    * New Page > / in chat > "Data" > "Select Database"

    * Ask for a data generator (e.g. "Create a tool to generate test data for /\[your database] using /ChatGPT")

    * Review generated entries before saving

    * Bulk add approved data to your database

    * Works with ChatGPT, Sonnet 3.5, and other AI models

**Update Schema**

* Upload new CSV with modified columns from the database viewer

* Create custom update tools with pages/functions from the builder

* Contact support for manual changes. Email us at[hello@create.xyz](mailto:hello@create.xyz)

**Joining Data**

You can create multiple related tables in your database:

* Describe the different tables you want in your prompt

* Create generates the appropriate schema and relationships

* Each table gets unique IDs automatically

Each row in your database has a unique ID. This lets you:

* Join data across tables in the same database

* Connect data between different databases

* Build relationships between user data and content

For example, imagine building a blog with user accounts:

1. Create a BlogPostsDB to store AI-generated posts

2. Enable User Accounts which creates UsersDB

3. When storing posts, include the current user's ID

4. Later, fetch posts filtered by user ID

The flow works because:

* Create stores the user ID from UsersDB with each blog post

* This connection lets you query posts by user

* You can join the data to show user details with posts

<Info>
  Create handles the relationship logic automatically when you describe how you want to connect the data in your prompt.
</Info>

## Other Actions

From the database viewer you can:

* Rename database

* Delete database

* Download data as CSV

## Pro Tips

* AI excels at database design. In ChatGPT or other LLMs, ask "What schema would work for \[your use case]?" and use the response in your database creation prompt

* Create your own admin pages to manage your data. You don't need to publish these, but they can help for managing.

* Use the same database across multiple pages for different views of your data

## Examples

You can use databases to build:

* Contact form submissions

* Content management systems

* CRMs

* Gallery submissions

* Storing image urls

* User feedback collection

* Catalogs

* And more
