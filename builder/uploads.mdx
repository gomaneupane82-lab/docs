Uploads let users add files to your app - like images, PDFs, documents, audio, and videos. Build galleries, AI tools that process text or documents, or just let users set profile pictures.

## Why Use Uploads

Uploads enable several capabilities:

- **File sharing** - Let users upload and share files
- **Galleries** - Build collections of images or videos
- **Documents** - Handle PDFs and other documents
- **User specific content** - Allow profile pictures and submissions with [User Accounts](/builder/user-accounts)

### Adding Uploads

```
Allow users to upload an image to set as their avatar in their profile
```

1. **Describe the upload flow**:
   - UI elements (buttons, drag areas)
   - Success/error states
   - What happens after upload
2. **Choose upload method**:
   - File selector
   - Drag and drop
   - URL input
   - Copy/paste
3. **Handle the file**:
   - Store URL in database
   - Display preview
   - Process content

Example prompts:

- "Add an image upload button to the form that shows a preview after its uploaded"
- "Let users drag PDFs to upload and store in /[Database]"
- "Create a profile picture uploader with cropping. Store the URLs in /[UsersDB]"

Create will write the code to support uploads based on your prompt. We recommend specificity in how you want to support uploads. Some common details to include:

1. UI around uploads
2. How the app should handle different states (uploads, error, success, etc.)
3. How the app should use the upload

Create automatically:

- Stores files securely
- Returns permanent URLs for the file stored on Create's cloud
- Handles file serving when you use the URL

To save uploads:

- Store URLs in [Databases](/builder/databases)
- Reference URLs in your app
- Query stored URLs later from the database

<Tip>
  Always store upload URLs in a database if you need to access files later. Without storage, URLs exist but are hard to find.
</Tip>

<Info>
  Create offers several integrations to help process uploaded files:

  - [File Conversion](/builder/integrations#file-conversion) - Convert between file formats like PDF, images, and more
  - [GPT-4 Vision](/builder/integrations#gpt-4-vision) - Analyze uploaded images
  - [Document Scanner](/builder/integrations#document-scanner) - Extract text from scanned documents
  - [Audio Transcription](/builder/integrations#audio-transcription) - Convert audio files to text
</Info>

### Technical Details

**Supported Upload Methods**:

- File upload
- URL import
- Base64 data
- Array buffers

**Considerations**:

- 10MB max file size
- Common web formats supported
- Files stored in Create's cloud

<Info>
  Add file size validation to prevent errors from large uploads. Just prompt Create to show an error if your users upload a larger file size.
