<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I create a new page, component, or other element?">
    Most things in Create can be found through the top left logo menu in the builder or by pressing / in the chat. Odds are it's there.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I add AI to my app?">
    Press / in the chat > choose our ChatGPT, Gemini, or Anthropic 3.5 Sonnet integration. Describe how you want to use it, and send the message.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which AI model is the best?">
    It really depends on your use case. Claude 3.5 Sonnet might be the best all around, but ChatGPT and others can be faster or higher quality in different use cases.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I connect to an external API?">
    You can try to see if we include it in our built in integrations (press /). If not, you can create a new [Function](/builder/functions).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add databases?">
    Yes. You can use our built in [Databases](/builder/databases) by pressing / in the chat > Data > Create a database. Describe how you want to store the data and send the message. You can also connect an external database through Functions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I host my app on Create? Will it scale to handle many users?">
    Yes, most of our users host their project on Create. Hit Publish in the top right. Your app will scale to handle many users. Reach out about our Business or Enterprise plans if concerned.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I add users, sign up, and sign in to my app?">
    You can use our built in [User Accounts](/builder/user-accounts) feature.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What language does Create write code in under the hood?">
    Create generates javascript web apps in React / Next.JS and functions in backend serverless functions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export the code?">
    Yes. Go to the Code tab > Download to download the Next.JS project. Note: for now Create only supports exporting a specific element.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I fix this error?">
    Check out our [Guide to Prompting](/prompting) or join our Discord community to chat with fellow creators. You can post in our #help-me-build channel.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should I use a Page vs. a Component vs. a Function vs. a Database vs. User accounts?">
    In general, we think you should start with the UI for your app (Pages, Components) and then move on to Functions, Databases, User Accounts as you need them:

    * [**Pages**](/builder/pages) are the screens of your app

    * [**Components**](/builder/components) are reusable UI elements so you don't have to keep re-making them

    * [**Functions**](/builder/functions) help you break up logic separate from the UI or talk to external APIs

    * [**Databases**](/builder/databases) let you store data so your app saves what users do in it

    * [**User Accounts**](/builder/user-accounts) gives you the ability for users to sign up, sign in and have the app protect content or customize experiences based on user data
