Create lets you collaborate with teammates in real time as you build your app together. Invite your designer, developer, agency, or anyone else to join your workspace.

## Getting started

Invite teammates in two steps:

- Click the **'Invite'** button in a project or from the dashboard
- Enter their email addresses to send invitations

When teammates accept their email invitations, they'll join your workspace and see your projects.

## Real-time collaboration

When teammates join your project:

- See their cursor and changes in real time
- Their icon appears in the top right corner
- Work together simultaneously on any element

The /build URL from the builder stays private by default. After inviting teammates, you can share this link for direct access.

## Managing access

- Teammates can access all projects in the workspace
- Switch between different teams from the dashboard side panel
- Teammates need to accept their email invitation to join

  Team member removal isn't supported in the UI yet. Email <a href="mailto:hello@create.xyz">[hello@create.xyz](mailto:hello@create.xyz)</a> if you need to remove someone from your workspace.
